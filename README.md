## What is Sustainable Development Goals?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33146152/160327143-e36bb1b9-ccea-4f96-b3b2-d92338dd56c5.png)

The Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint" to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.
There are 17 goals.

## Our goal

We selected several of the UN's 17 sustainable development goals to create our application. We found that our solution mostly focuses on solving "Zero Hunger" & promoting "Economic Growth".
